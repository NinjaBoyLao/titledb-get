This is just a simple parser for 3DS system title databases (title.db / import.db). Keep in mind databases have to be decrypted for this to work. This tool has no use on its own, it is purely for educational purposes. This repo also includes the 'importfix.cpp' source file, which was written based on 'tdbget.cpp' and is designed to help (experimentally, this might be dangerous!) liberating an exiting import.db from the update nag.
